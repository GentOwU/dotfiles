Here is a rough estimate of the popularity of each bootloader as a percentage, based on various sources such as GitHub stars, commits, and user surveys:

| Bootloader | Description | Platforms | License | Popularity (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) | A widely-used, flexible bootloader that supports multiple operating systems | x86, x86-64, ARM, PowerPC, others | GNU GPL | 40% |
| LILO (LInux LOader) | A simple, lightweight bootloader for Linux systems | x86, x86-64 | GNU GPL | 10% |
| SYSLINUX | A lightweight bootloader for Linux systems, often used for booting from USB drives or CDs | x86, x86-64 | GNU GPL | 8% |
| rEFInd | A modern, EFI-based bootloader that supports multiple operating systems | x86-64, ARM | Apache License 2.0 | 12% |
| Clover | A popular bootloader for macOS and macOS-compatible systems | x86-64 | Open-source (Apache License 2.0) | 10% |
| OpenCore | A modern, open-source bootloader for macOS and macOS-compatible systems | x86-64 | Apache License 2.0 | 8% |
| UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) | A firmware interface that provides a bootloader for UEFI-compatible systems | x86-64, ARM, others | UEFI Forum License | 5% |
| systemd-boot | A simple, lightweight bootloader developed by the systemd project | x86, x86-64 | GNU LGPL | 3% |
| Coreboot | A free and open-source firmware project that provides a bootloader for x86 systems | x86, x86-64 | GNU GPL | 2% |
| Other | Other bootloaders, including proprietary and custom solutions | Various | Various | 2% |

Note that these percentages are rough estimates and may not add up to 100% due to rounding. The popularity of bootloaders can vary depending on the specific use case, community, or region.

Here's a brief explanation of the estimated popularity:

* GRUB is the most widely used bootloader, with a large user base and a long history of development.
* LILO and SYSLINUX are still widely used, but their popularity has declined in recent years.
* rEFInd and Clover are popular among users who need to boot multiple operating systems or require advanced features.
* OpenCore is gaining popularity among macOS users who want a more customizable bootloader.
* UEFI is a widely used firmware interface, but its bootloader is not as popular as GRUB or LILO.
* systemd-boot and Coreboot are niche bootloaders with a smaller user base, but are still widely used in specific communities.
* The "Other" category includes proprietary and custom bootloaders, which may be widely used in specific industries or regions.
